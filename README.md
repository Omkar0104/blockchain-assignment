## 1. Range of Motion Calculation

### 1.1. `getRangeGained` Function

The `getRangeGained` function calculates the range of motion gained during a specific exercise.

#### Parameters:

- `maxAngle` (number): The maximum angle reached during the exercise.
- `minAngle` (number): The minimum angle reached during the exercise.
- `bodypart` (string): The body part involved in the exercise (e.g., "Hip", "Shoulder", "Elbow", "Knee").
- `exercise_name` (string): The name of the exercise (e.g., "Adduction", "Extension").

#### Returns:

- `number`: The calculated range of motion gained.
